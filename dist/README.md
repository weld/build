====

What is it?
------------

{CUSTOM_TEXT}: Contexts and Dependency Injection
for the Java EE Platform which is the Java standard for dependency injection and 
contextual lifecycle management and one of the most important and popular parts 
of the Java EE platform.

Weld is integrated into many Java EE application servers such as WildFly, 
JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, GlassFish, Oracle WebLogic and others. 
Weld can also be used in a Servlet-only environment (Tomcat, Jetty) or plain 
Java SE environment.
